# Ansible playbook for flashing your ZSH coordinator
This playbook is based on the steps mentioned on the [Electrolama docs](https://electrolama.com/radio-docs/#step-2-download-the-correct-firmware-for-your-stick).

## How to use it
> Note: at the moment, the playbook is using a lot of hardcopy values. This is something to improve later on.

### Prerequisites
To start using this playbook, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. ansible, python3 and pip3 installed
2. changed the `work_dir` variable in `group_vars/all.yaml` to a suitable location.

## Disclaimer
In no way I am affliated with Electrolama, nor do I work for them. They just make awesome stuff.
